🔥 Darling-Nft-Preview-Component

🚀 Frontend Mentor Challenge 

👋
Hello again, everyone! I'm back with a project update on 'Sheshh.' It's a challenge I found on the Frontend Mentor website. I've successfully created an NFT card component using React.js and CSS. However, at the moment, it lacks functionality and only features a hover animation.
 would greatly appreciate it if you could help me refine the project. I'm seeking advice on enhancing its functionality and adding new features. Here are some areas where I need assistance.
